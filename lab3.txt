Lab 3
1. Display the date of exam as the following: day 'month 
name' year.

 SELECT ex_id, TO_CHAR(ex_date, 'DD Mon YYYY') AS "FormattedDate"
FROM exam;

---------------------------------------------------------------------



2. Create function which takes subject id and return the 
number of students who failed in a subject. (score less 
than 50)

CREATE FUNCTION failed_student(subject_id INTEGER)
RETURNS INTEGER AS
$$
DECLARE
    failed INTEGER;
BEGIN
    SELECT COUNT(*)
    INTO failed
    FROM grades
    WHERE sub_id = subject_id AND grade < 50;

    RETURN failed;
END;
$$
LANGUAGE plpgsql;


---------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Create Table called Deleted_Students which will hold 
the deleted studentsâ€™ info (same columns as in student 
tables).


create table student (
student_id int primary key,
student_name varchar(20),
student_email varchar(20),
student_address varchar(20),
student_phone varchar(20),
track_id int);



---------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Create trigger to save the deleted student from Student 
table to Deleted_Students.





create function del_students ()
returns trigger 
as $$
begin
insert into deleted_students (student_id,student_name) values
(old.s_id, old.s_name);
return old;
end;
$$
language plpgsql;

create trigger save_del_students 
after delete on student for each row
execute procedure del_students();

delete from student where s_id=7;

select * from deleted_students;




---------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Create trigger to save the newly added students to 
Student table to Backup_Students.






create table backup_students (
stu_id int primary key,
stu_name varchar(20)
)

create function new_students()
returns trigger as 
$$
begin 
insert into backup_students (stu_id,stu_name)
values (new.s_id , new.s_name);
return new;
end;
$$
language plpgsql

create trigger saved_students after insert 
on student for each row 
execute procedure new_students();

insert into student (s_id,s_name)
values (8,'taghreed');

select * from backup_students;






---------------------------------------------------------------------
6. Create trigger to keep track the changes of contact info 
table (add/update rows). It will log the time of action 
and description of action to another table



create table contact_info (
 id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    email VARCHAR(255),
    phone_number VARCHAR(20)
);

CREATE TABLE contact_info_log (
    log_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    contact_id INT,
    action_description VARCHAR(255),
    action_time TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE FUNCTION log_contact_info_changes()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
    IF TG_OP = 'INSERT' THEN
        INSERT INTO contact_info_log (contact_id, action_description)
        VALUES (NEW.id, 'New contact added');
    ELSIF TG_OP = 'UPDATE' THEN
        INSERT INTO contact_info_log (contact_id, action_description)
        VALUES (NEW.id, 'Contact info updated');
    END IF;

    RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE TRIGGER contact_info_trigger
AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE
ON contact_info
FOR EACH ROW
EXECUTE FUNCTION log_contact_info_changes();

INSERT INTO contact_info (name, email, phone_number) VALUES ('Taghreed', 'taghreed@gmail.com', '01245668');

SELECT * FROM contact_info_log;

UPDATE contact_info SET phone_number = '123' WHERE name = 'Taghreed';
